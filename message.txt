Hello @${username}, 
It seems like you may have been trying to remove your password or auth token from this repo. If not, just ignore this message.

Sadly, it doesn’t work that way. Git is a version control system, so anyone can see past versions of your repo _including your credentials_! What’s more, people can easily find your password just by searching for commits including the word “password” or “token”!

The right thing to do is to change your password or invalidate your token _now_. If this is not possible, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/872565/remove-sensitive-files-and-their-commits-from-git-history) for info about removing this file from Git history and hope that other bots or people saw it. 

Next time be careful not to upload your credentials in the first place, and make sure to remove them more thoroughly. 

Do you have feedback about this bot, find it annoying and want to nag me to reduce false positives, or just want to say hello? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Heath123/CredentialReminderBot/issues/new) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/Heath123/CredentialReminderBot/discussions).
